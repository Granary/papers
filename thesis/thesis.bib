    abstract = {{Software instrumentation provides the means to collect information on and efficiently analyze parallel programs. Using Pin, developers can build tools to detect and examine dynamic behavior including data races, memory system behavior, and parallelizable loops. Pin is a software system that performs runtime binary instrumentation of Linux and Microsoft Windows applications. Pin's aim is to provide an instrumentation platform for building a wide variety of program analysis tools, called pintools. By performing the instrumentation on the binary at runtime, Pin eliminates the need to modify or recompile the application's source and supports the instrumentation of programs that dynamically generate code.}},
